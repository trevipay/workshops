# Research & Lightning Talks

## Problem statement

Spend the first ten minutes researching a deployment methodology and then give
a five minute or less lightening talk. For items that are an application
architecture focus on how to deploy them. Some options include blue/green,
micro-services, service-oriented architecture (SOA), Heroku/git push,
Kubernetes/containerization, zero-downtime, etc.

## Discussion points

Identify the problems each methodology solves and try to imagine the areas they
may not address as well. Try to reinforce that everything has tradeoffs.
